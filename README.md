# Sales-Insights
As part of the Codebasics PowerBi YouTube playlist, I replicated the AtliQ Sales Insights PowerBi Dashboard. This project aimed to help AtliQ Hardware—a company delivering computer hardware and peripherals—make data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement:

AtliQ faced declining sales and frustration due to Excel overload. The sales director needed a better way to understand business performance.

Solution: 

We built a PowerBI Dashboard, converting raw data into visual insights. Our steps included SQL analysis, ETL, currency conversion, and creating custom measures. The result? An interactive dashboard that empowered decision-making!

Steps followed:

1.Analyzed data in SQL.

2.Connected SQL data to Power BI.

3.Performed ETL and data cleaning.

4.Converted currencies.

5.Created measures.

6.Designed Power BI visuals.
